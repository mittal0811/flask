## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- create a pipenv environment using "pipenv shell" in the main.py folder
- run "pipenv install" <-- this will install the require dependency listed in pipfile>
- use flask run command to start ( make sure FLASK_ENV is set to "main" using export in linux or mac)

# Here is what I learned while installing this project:

- I tried pipenv and installed all depenedencies in addition to gunicorn,
  and it works perfectly with Heroku buildpack mentioned in railway.app flask
  implementation, it works for sure for this project.

- mysqlclient does not seem to work on regular implmentation given by railway.app

- mysqlclient does not also working on local machine in pipenv as it does not have
  access to the mysqlclient of local machine. To make it work on local machine:
  use pip instead of pipenv for local machine.
